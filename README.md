<h3>About The Project</h3>
<p>HELLOüñêüñê!So this project is all about analysing the brainsignals in various environment which could be further developed for analyzing the <br>
  <b>concentration<br>meditation levels<br> and corelate that with each other which also includes a record of blink strength</b> </p>

    <li>Neurons as messengers: Brains are made of billions of nerve cells called neurons, which are the primary units for transmitting information. 
</li>
    <li>Brain signals are short, millisecond-long electrical impulses that facilitate communication between neurons. </li>
    <li>Brain waves are oscillating electrical voltages in the brain that represent the collective electrical activity of large groups of neurons. There are different types of brain waves (e.g., alpha, beta, delta, theta), each associated with different states of consciousness and brain function.
